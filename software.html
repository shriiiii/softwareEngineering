							<h2>Welcome to Software Engineering</h2>


								<p>Software Engineering is class that teaches the aspects and physiology of
									computer science that allows students to learn the vigors of the field of
									computer science. Within the 3 years of this program, students will cover the
									basic programming languages using scratch, html, java, javascript.
									They will learn the syntax while also gaining the ability of implementing the
									syntax to other programming language. As their knowledge expands, students will have
									the ability of using what they have learned and create personal projects using what
									they have learned.</p>

								<h2>Our Goal</h2>
								<br>

								<p>The purpose of this class is to prepare students not only for college in any STEM field, but also for the professional world.
								 Students will learn how to solve any type of problems in a working environment through problem-solving skills. Students will also learn how to properly work as a team while
								 finishing up projects in time.
								 <br>
							 </p>
							 <br>

				<p><strong><center>There are 5 steps to a successful projects.</center></strong></p>
				<br>

<center>1. Understand the problem.
	<br>

2. Define the core of your solution (Algorithm).
<br>

3. Test plan.
<br>

4. Flowchart.
<br>

								<h2>Year 3</h2>
								<p>Year 3 is renamed to AP Computer Sceince A. By this time, students will know how to manage their time properly. While taking this course, students will work on creating their own android app using Java.
									The AP Computer Science A course
	introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design
	strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data
	(algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The
	course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design. These techniques
	represent proven approaches for development solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems
	to large, complex problems.</p>

	<h3><center><strong>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</strong></center></h3>

	<li>Design and implement computer-based solutions to problems.</li>
	<li>Use and implement commonly used algorithms and data structures.</li>
	<li>Develop and select appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve new problems.</li>
	<li>Write solutions fluently an object-oriented paradigm</li>
	<li>Write, run, test and debug solutions in the Java programming language</li>
	<li>Read and understand programs consisting of several classes and interacting objects</li>
	<li>Read and understand a description of the design and development process</li>
	<li>Understand the ethical and social implications of computer use.</li>

								<h2>Internships & Programs</h2>
								<p>The following are some of the programs and hackathons that
									students in the Software Engineering class have been involved in.
 A highly competitive summer immersion program that aims to end the gender gap in
 STEM-related fields by introducing girls to Computer Science and encouraging them
 to pursue a career in STEM.</p> <br><br>

  <li><strong>Girls Who Code</strong> has a curriculum focusing on robotics,
 graphics and animation, mobile applications, data structures and algorithms, etc.
 while working with programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, Python, CSS, and jQuery.</li>

 <li><strong>CTE Industry Scholars</strong>  - The Career and Technical Education (CTE) Industry Scholars Program supports high school students in advancing their postsecondary education and career aspirations though valuable hands on experience.</li>
<li><strong>DESIGN SCHOLARS</strong> - Get a head start on a future in design! Teens in New York City can apply to be a DesignPrep Scholar, a free program that features hands-on workshops with professional designers, design studio visits, and college tours.</li>
<li><strong>NASA Internships and Fellowships</strong> - NASA Internships are competitive awards to support educational opportunities that provide unique NASA-related research and operational experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as educators. These opportunities serve students by integrating interns with career professionals emphasizing mentor-directed, degree-related tasks, while contributing to the operation of a NASA facility or the advancement of NASA's missions.
</li>
<li><strong>Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE)</strong> - This full-time, seven week program includes: a high level, 5-week authentic research experience in participating NYU faculty labs, mentoring in that placement by a graduate or postdoctoral student, a stipend of at least $500 for completing the program, as well as two weeks of workshops, college advisement and other activities geared to preparing ARISE students for the college application process.  In the workshops, students will be introduced to the field of scientific ethics, contemporary issues in scientific inquiry, data collection and analysis, research practices, lab safety and more.</li>
